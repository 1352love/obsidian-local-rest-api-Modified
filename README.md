# Local REST API for Obsidian

See our interactive docs: https://coddingtonbear.github.io/obsidian-local-rest-api/

Have you ever needed to automate interacting with your notes?  This plugin gives Obsidian a REST API you can interact with your notes from other tools so you can automate what you need to automate.

This plugin provides a secure HTTPS interface gated behind api key authentication that allows you to:

- Read, create, update or delete existing notes.  There's even a `PATCH` HTTP method for inserting content into your section.
- List notes stored in your vault.
- Create and fetch periodic notes.
- Execute commands and list what commands are available.

Hopefully you find this as useful as I do!
